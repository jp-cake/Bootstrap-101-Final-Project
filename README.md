# Bootstrap-101-Final-Project

I'm taking this course on Udemy: https://www.udemy.com/course/the-ultimate-fullstack-web-development-bootcamp/

For the final project in the Bootstrap section, I had to pick one of the official Bootstrap templates (without looking at their code...) and I selected this one by Simpleqode: https://themes.getbootstrap.com/product/touche-cafe-restaurant-theme/
